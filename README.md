# datascience-c collection
Simple collection of datascience algorithms and techniques that I'm currently grinding. I know it is a bit inconvenient to use C-language since this one's hella bit too low-level for these kind of tasks.. but hey, I like challenges ;>

## libraries
- **knn.c** - a simple library that uses knn algorithm for drawing conclusions, documentation can be seen [here](libraries/README.md).
